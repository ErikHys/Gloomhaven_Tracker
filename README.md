# Gloomhaven_Tracker
Trying to make a Gloomhaven tracker to track personal quest, exp, gold, items to learn more about kotlin.


# Plan

* Be able to add characters
  * Button to lead to new screen
  * New screen initially contains fillable fields that are generic, fill class, quest,hp, exp...
    * Future create templates that autofill based on lvl and class
* Store and modify character values locally
  * Button to enter specific character, and exit
  * In character screen buttons to adjust values
  * Future: art based on class
* Make pretty
